### Overview
1. Overview: An application that will allow automotive service departments and their customers stay in contact easier and able to keep records of service easier. Many service departments have software that allow record keeping but customers do not have the same app on their end. Also, many times customers are kept out of the loop when their cars are being serviced. This app will allow notifications with every stage their car is in and also a timeline on how long they should be expecting their car to be in service. It will also be able to keep transferable car records so that if customers want to sell their car, the records will transfer via the app.
